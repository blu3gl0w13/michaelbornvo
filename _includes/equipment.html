                                    <p class="text-muted">Every voice-over artist knows that using a sound isolation booth is paramount to making a quality recording. A proper setup will not only keep as much sound out as possible but will enhance the sound experience inside the booth itself making sure each frequency is well balanced with the others. Incorrect setup can increase the bass frequency or create too much echo. Michael Born uses a setup that achieves a healthy balance of sound isolation and proper acoustics when recording voice-overs.</p>
